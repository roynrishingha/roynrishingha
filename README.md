Hi, I’m **Nrishinghananda Roy** — a backend engineer who writes Rust because I care about how systems behave.
I’m drawn to code that runs deep: runtimes, compilers, low-level performance, and developer tools that make software better for everyone.

I’ve spent the last 3 years building production systems with Rust—refactoring pipelines in Rust for speed, replacing legacy services with clean, native solutions, and pushing code that earns its place.
Lately, I’ve been going deeper into WebAssembly and compiler internals—chasing the question of how code becomes what it runs on.

I often contribute to Rust Clippy, writing lints that help Rustaceans write faster, clearer, more idiomatic code. That work has taken me inside the compiler, and I don’t think I’m coming back.

If you're working on infrastructure, tooling, or the invisible layers that make things possible—and you care about precision, performance, and the soul of good engineering—I'd love to connect.
