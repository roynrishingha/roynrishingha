ðŸ‘‹ Greetings!

I am Nrishinghananda Roy, a dedicated and self-motivated software engineer with a primary focus on the Rust programming language. Currently, I am honing my skills in backend development while also gaining proficiency in Typescript, React, and Material UI for frontend projects in my current role.

In my professional journey, I have successfully contributed to the development of high-performance and cost-effective APIs using Rust. My passion lies in the Rust backend space, and I am committed to expanding my expertise in this domain.

Looking ahead, I am excited about exploring network programming and async programming with Rust. These areas fuel my curiosity, and I aspire to delve into them in the distant future.

I am enthusiastic about contributing to open-source and connecting with fellow professionals in the software engineering community, sharing insights, and exploring potential collaborations. If you share a similar passion for Rust and general software engineering skills, I would love to connect with you.
