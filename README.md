ðŸ‘‹ Greetings!

Myself Nrishinghananda Roy, a self-motivated software engineer with a primary focus on the Rust language. Currently, I am honing my skills in backend development with Rust while also gaining proficiency in Python, Typescript & React for projects in my current job. 

I'm primarily focused in the Rust backend space. Specially to develop high-performance and cost-effective APIs. And I often contribute into open-source Rust projects.
