## Who I am

Hi 👋 I'm Nrishinghananda Roy, a Rust-focused software engineer with 3+ years building backend and systems software for startups in Germany, France, and India. I work best where speed and reliability both matter.

## What I do

- Ship features end-to-end: from API design to infra deployment.
- Replace slow code with fast Rust implementations.
- Contribute to open-source Rust projects.
- Build developer tools and system-level libraries.


## How I work

- Take loosely defined problems and return working solutions.
- Own my code in production—if it breaks, I know how to fix it.
- Balance speed with reliability—ship quickly without cutting corners.
- Care about performance, correctness, and clarity, not hype-driven features.

## Where I’m going

Deepening expertise in Rust systems and developer tooling (editors, runtimes). My focus is software that lasts—tools and infrastructure teams can rely on long after version one.
