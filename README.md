Hi, I’m **Nrishinghananda Roy**—a self-taught Rust developer with a passion for backend systems and a strong drive to learn and grow. My journey in tech wasn’t conventional. Growing up in rural India, I faced significant challenges, including limited access to resources and formal university education. But these obstacles fueled my determination, and I immersed myself in coding, with Rust quickly becoming my go-to language for its power, safety, and performance.

My journey has taught me resilience and adaptability. I’m passionate about learning and giving back through open-source, where I connect with others who share my dedication. Excited to keep growing, building, and contributing to impactful projects in Rust and backend tech.
