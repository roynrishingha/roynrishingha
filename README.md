Hi 👋 I’m Nrishinghananda Roy.

For the past few years, I’ve been building backend systems at early-stage startups — mostly using Rust  🦀, sometimes Python and TypeScript. I’ve worked in small teams where the problems don’t come pre-packaged or neatly scoped. You figure it out, you ship it, and if it breaks under pressure, it’s on you to fix it. That kind of environment shaped how I think: you learn fast, you take responsibility, and you build things that won’t fall apart at 2 a.m.

I’ve always been drawn to the quieter parts of engineering — the layers that most people don’t see but that everything else depends on. Not flashy features or pixel-perfect UIs, but the systems behind the scenes: infrastructure, runtimes, observability, performance bottlenecks. I care about how things work — deeply, internally, at the level where correctness and clarity really matter.

Over time, I’ve found myself diving deeper into the Rust ecosystem — contributing to tools like Clippy, exploring production-grade open source projects, and learning how large-scale systems are built with precision and care. It’s not easy work, but it’s the kind of work that holds up. And that’s what I’m here for — engineering that lasts.

Right now, I’m focused on backend systems written in Rust — especially projects that build infrastructure for developers. I’m contributing to open-source projects, leveling up my skills, and learning how to solve problems. What drives me is the pursuit of mastery, not just “more experience” but deeper experience — the kind you earn by putting in the reps on real systems that serve real users.

I’m not here to chase trends. I’m here to build things that work, with people who take their craft seriously. If that’s you too, I’d love to connect.
